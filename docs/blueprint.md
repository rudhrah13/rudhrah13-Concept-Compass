## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#ADD8E6) to evoke a sense of calmness, trust, and intellect associated with learning. This color fosters an environment of clarity and understanding.
- Background color: Off-white (#F9F9F9) to ensure clarity, readability, and to maintain a focus on the content, reducing distractions.
- Accent color: Soft Green (#90EE90) to highlight correct answers and positive feedback, associating growth and positivity with the learning process.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) combines modernity and approachability.
- Use clear, simple icons to represent subjects and concepts. Icons should be monochromatic and consistent with the overall minimalist design.
- Maintain a clean, uncluttered layout with ample whitespace to enhance readability. Prioritize a logical flow from subject selection to question answering to feedback.
- Use subtle transitions and animations (e.g., fading in feedback) to provide a smooth and engaging user experience without being distracting.
